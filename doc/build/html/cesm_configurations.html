<span id="configurations"></span><h1>3. CESM2 Configurations<a class="headerlink" href="#cesm2-configurations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The CESM2 system can be configured a number of different ways from both a
science and technical perspective. CESM supports numerous
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/cesm/grids.html">resolutions</a>, and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2.0/cesm/compsets.html">component sets</a>.
In addition, each model
component has input options to configure specific model physics and
parameterizations.</p>
<div class="section" id="cesm-components">
<h2>3.1. CESM Components<a class="headerlink" href="#cesm-components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>CESM consists of seven geophysical model components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>atmosphere (atm)</li>
<li>sea-ice (ice)</li>
<li>land (lnd)</li>
<li>river (rof)</li>
<li>ocean (ocn),</li>
<li>land-ice (glc)</li>
<li>ocean-wave (wav)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition CESM is accompanied by a driver/coupler (cpl7) that
coordinates the time evolution of geophysical components and
periocially permits the components to exchange data.  Each component is
represented in one of several modes:
&#8220;active,&#8221; &#8220;data,&#8221; &#8220;dead,&#8221; or &#8220;stub&#8221; that permits the whole
system to activate and deactive component feedbacks by allowing for a
variety of &#8220;plug and play&#8221; combinations.</p>
<p>During the course of a CESM run, the model components integrate forward
in time, periodically exchanging information with the coupler.
The coupler meanwhile receives fields from the component models,
computes, maps, and merges this information, then sends the fields back
to the component models. The coupler brokers this sequence of
communication interchanges and manages the overall time progression of
the coupled system. A CESM component set is comprised of seven
components: one component from each model (atm, lnd, rof, ocn, ice, glc,
and wav) plus the coupler. Model components are written primarily in
Fortran.</p>
<p>The active (dynamical) components are generally fully prognostic, and
they are state-of-the-art climate prediction and analysis tools. Because
the active models are relatively expensive to run, data models that
cycle input data are included for testing, spin-up, and model
parameterization development. The dead components generate
scientifically invalid data and exist only to support technical system
testing. The dead components must all be run together and should never
be combined with any active or data versions of models. Stub components
exist only to satisfy interface requirements when the component is not
needed for the model configuration (e.g., the active land component
forced with atmospheric data does not need ice, ocn, or glc components,
so ice, ocn, and glc stubs are used).</p>
<p>The CESM components can be summarized as follows:</p>

<h2>3.2. CESM Component Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#cesm-component-sets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The CESM components can be combined in numerous ways to carry out
various scientific or software experiments. A particular mix of
components, <em>along with</em> component-specific configuration and/or
namelist settings is called a component set or &#8220;compset.&#8221; CESM has a
shorthand naming convention for component sets that are supported
out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>The compset name usually has a well defined first letter followed by
some characters that are indicative of the configuration setup. Each
compset name has a corresponding short name. Users are not limited to
the predefined component set combinations. A user may define their own
component set</p>
<div class="admonition-todo admonition" id="index-0">
<p class="first admonition-title">Todo</p>
<p class="last">put in link for creating your own compset into the CIME user&#8217;s guide</p>
</div>
<p>See <a class="reference external" href="../modelnl/compsets.html">supported component sets</a> for a
complete list of supported compset options. Running
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">manage\_case</span></code> with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--query-compsets_setby</span></code> option will
also always provide a listing of the supported out-of-the-box component
sets for the local version of CESM.</p>
<p>In general, the first letter of a compset name indicates which
components are used. An exception to this rule is the use of &#8220;G&#8221; as a
second letter to indicate use of the active glc model, CISM.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cesm-grids">
<h2>3.3. CESM Grids<a class="headerlink" href="#cesm-grids" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The grids are specified in CESM by setting an overall model resolution.
Once the overall model resolution is set, components will read in
appropriate grids files and the coupler will read in appropriate mapping
weights files. Coupler mapping weights are always generated externally
in CESM. The components will send the grid data to the coupler at
initialization, and the coupler will check that the component grids are
consistent with each other and with the mapping weights files.</p>
<p>In CESM1.2, the ocean and ice must be on the same grid, but the
atmosphere and land and river runoff can each be on different grids.
Each component determines its own unique grid decomposition based upon
the total number of pes assigned to that component.</p>
<p>CESM supports several types of grids out-of-the-box including single
point, finite volume, spectral, cubed sphere, displaced pole, and
tripole. This page, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.image.ucar.edu/staff/rnair/remap.html">Conservative Remapping on Spherical
Grids</a>, illustrates
a number of these grid types. These grids are used internally by the
models. Input datasets are usually on the same grid but in some cases,
they can be interpolated from regular lon/lat grids in the data models.
The finite volume and spectral grids are generally associated with
atmosphere and land models but the data ocean and data ice models are
also supported on those grids. The cubed sphere grid is used only by the
active atmosphere model, cam. And the displaced pole and tripole grids
are used by the ocean and ice models. Not every grid can be run by every
component. The ocean and ice models run on either a Greenland dipole or
a tripole grid. The <a class="reference external" href="gx3v7_120309_pole.png">Greenland Pole grid</a> is a
latitude/longitude grid, with the North Pole displaced over Greenland to
avoid singularity problems in the ocn and ice models. The low-resolution
Greenland pole mesh from CCSM3 is illustrated in <a class="reference external" href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI3744.1">Yeager et al., &#8220;The
Low-Resolution CCSM3&#8221;, AMS (2006), Figure 1b.,
Web.</a>
Similarly, the <a class="reference external" href="http://climate.lanl.gov/Models/POP/">Poseidon tripole
grid</a> is a latitude/longitude
grid with three poles that are all centered over land.</p>
<p>CESM1.2 has a completely new <a class="reference external" href="#grid_names">naming convention for model
resolutions</a>. Using this naming convention, the complete
list of currently supported grid resolutions can be viewed at <a class="reference external" href="../modelnl/grid.html">supported
resolutions page</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="cesm-machines">
<h2>3.4. CESM Machines<a class="headerlink" href="#cesm-machines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Scripts for supported machines and userdefined machines are provided
with the CESM release. Supported machines have machine specific files
and settings added to the CESM scripts and are machines that should run
CESM cases out-of-the-box. Machines are supported in CESM on an
individual basis and are usually listed by their common site-specific
name. To get a machine ported and functionally supported in CESM, local
batch, run, environment, and compiler information must be configured in
the CESM scripts. The machine name &#8220;userdefined&#8221; machines refer to any
machine that the user defines and requires that a user edit the
resulting xml files to fill in information required for the target
platform. This functionality is handy in accelerating the porting
process and quickly getting a case running on a new platform. For more
information on porting, see ?. The list of available machines are
documented in <a class="reference external" href="../modelnl/machines.html">CESM supported machines</a>.
Running <a class="reference external" href="#how_to_create_case">create_newcase</a> with the &#8220;-list&#8221;
option will also show the list of available machines for the current
local version of CESM. Supported machines have undergone the full CESM
<a class="reference external" href="#port">porting process</a>. The machines available in each of these
categories changes as access to machines change over time.</p>

<div class="section" id="cesm-validation">
<h2>3.5. CESM Validation<a class="headerlink" href="#cesm-validation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Although CESM can be run out-of-the-box for a variety of resolutions,
component combinations, and machines, MOST combinations of component
sets, resolutions, and machines have not undergone rigorous scientific
climate validation. Control runs accompany &#8220;scientifically supported&#8221;
component sets and resolution and are documented on the release page.
These control runs should be scientifically reproducible on the original
platform or other platforms. Bit-for-bit reproducibility cannot be
guaranteed due to variations in compiler or system versions. Users
should carry out their own validations on any platform prior to doing
scientific runs or scientific analysis and documentation.</p>
